## üéØ AI Event Content Generation System

**IMPORTANT:** If the user describes an event they want to create (e.g., "I want to do a Vibelabs event on November 20th about AI agents"), immediately follow the instructions in `event-generation-instructions.md`.

### How It Works

This events folder includes an intelligent content generation system that creates event pages, front-page blurbs, and email announcements in the authentic Vibelabs tone of voice.

**User Experience:**
1. User describes event in natural language
2. System generates complete draft immediately (with placeholders for missing info)
3. System asks clarifying questions about missing details
4. User provides answers, system regenerates
5. Iterate until user is satisfied
6. User edits and saves finalized content ‚Üí system learns automatically

**Key Files (Priority Order):**
- `tone-overrides.md` - **HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Active tone instructions from user
- `event-generation-instructions.md` - Master prompt document (read this to generate content)
- `tone-of-voice-guide.md` - Human-editable style guide extracted from historical events
- `tone-learnings.json` - Automated pattern tracking with temporal weighting
- `/generated/YYYY/MM/` - Where drafts are saved

**Priority System:** tone-overrides.md > tone-of-voice-guide.md > tone-learnings.json

**Event Types Supported:**
- **Vibelabs Community** (primary focus) - Free events, casual tone, pizza emoji üçï
- **Shifter Courses** - Commercial full-day courses, structured format
- **ANFO Partnership** - Professional events for marketing leaders
- **Corporate Training** - Custom workshops, flexible format

**Output Format:**
Single markdown file with three clearly marked sections:
1. EVENT PAGE CONTENT - Full event description (200-400 words)
2. FRONT-PAGE BLURB - Promotional snippet (50-100 words)
3. EMAIL ANNOUNCEMENT - Complete email with subject line (200-300 words)

**Learning System:**
- The system learns from finalized content automatically
- Newer content weighted more heavily (temporal decay)
- Manual overrides: Edit `tone-of-voice-guide.md` directly
- Automatic pattern tracking in `tone-learnings.json`

**When User Describes an Event:**
‚Üí Read `event-generation-instructions.md` and follow the workflow exactly
‚Üí Check `tone-overrides.md` FIRST for active instructions
‚Üí DO NOT ask questions first - generate immediately with smart defaults
‚Üí Use placeholders `[ITEM TBD]` for truly unknown information
‚Üí Reference historical events for tone and structure examples
‚Üí Save to `/generated/YYYY/MM/event-name-draft.md`

**When User Provides Tone Instructions:**
If the user says something like:
- "Tone down the use of emojis drastically"
- "Make everything more professional"
- "Keep content concise, under 200 words"
- "Always mention our V0 partnership prominently"

‚Üí Immediately update `tone-overrides.md` with the instruction
‚Üí Use clear format: `**OVERRIDE:** [actionable instruction]`
‚Üí Confirm the change with the user
‚Üí Apply to all future generations automatically

**Examples:**
```markdown
User: "Use fewer emojis"
‚Üí Add to tone-overrides.md: **OVERRIDE:** Use maximum 1 emoji per output

User: "Remove that emoji restriction"
‚Üí Remove or comment out the emoji override in tone-overrides.md
```
