# Event Content Generation Instructions

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Master prompt for AI agents generating Vibelabs event content
**Trigger:** User describes an event in natural language
**Output:** Event page, front-page blurb, and email announcement

---

## Quick Start

When the user describes an event (e.g., "I want to do a Vibelabs event on Nov 20 about AI agents"), immediately:

1. **Read these files in priority order:**
   - `tone-overrides.md` - **READ FIRST** - Active overrides (highest priority)
   - `tone-of-voice-guide.md` - Manual style guide (second priority)
   - `tone-learnings.json` - Automated patterns (third priority)
   - Historical event files (vibelabs-events.md, shifter-courses.md, etc.) - Examples

   **Priority System:** tone-overrides.md > tone-of-voice-guide.md > tone-learnings.json

   **If there's a conflict, always apply the instruction from the higher-priority file.**

2. **Detect event type** (see Event Type Detection below)

3. **Generate immediately** with placeholders for missing info

4. **Save draft** to `/generated/YYYY/MM/event-name-draft.md`

5. **Ask clarifying questions** for missing information

6. **Iterate** until user is satisfied

---

## Event Type Detection

Analyze the user's natural language input for keywords and context:

### Vibelabs Community Events
**Trigger keywords:** "Vibelabs", "Mesh", "community", "free event", "monthly", "weekly", "public"
**Default assumptions:** Free, Mesh venue, pizza, V0 partnership, 17:00 start
**Tone:** Casual, enthusiastic, Norwegian-heavy, moderate emoji use
**Primary file reference:** `vibelabs-events.md`

### Shifter Commercial Courses
**Trigger keywords:** "Shifter", "commercial", "full-day course", "paid", "Schibsted"
**Default assumptions:** 09:00-16:00, prerequisites required, ~NOK 300+ participant investment
**Tone:** Professional but accessible, structured, value-focused
**Primary file reference:** `shifter-courses.md`

### ANFO Partnership Events
**Trigger keywords:** "ANFO", "advertisers", "brands", "marketing leaders", "corporate audience"
**Default assumptions:** Professional audience, mixed pricing, ANFO venues
**Tone:** Professional, strategic, formal Norwegian
**Primary file reference:** `anfo-events.md`

### Corporate Training
**Trigger keywords:** Company names, "workshop", "training", "corporate", "private", "team"
**Default assumptions:** Client offices, flexible format, custom pricing
**Tone:** Customizable, professional-casual balance
**Primary file reference:** `corporate-biz-dev.md`

**Default when ambiguous:** Vibelabs community event (ask for clarification if unsure)

---

## Information Extraction

Parse the user's natural language input to extract:

### Essential Information
- **Event type** (Vibelabs, Shifter, ANFO, Corporate)
- **Date** (specific date or relative like "next Tuesday")
- **Time** (start time, optionally end time)
- **Theme/topic** (what the event is about)
- **Title** (if provided, otherwise generate from theme)

### Important Information
- **Venue/location** (use defaults if not specified)
- **Guest speakers** (names and affiliations)
- **Capacity** (registration limit)
- **Format** (workshop, presentation, hands-on, etc.)
- **Duration** (or infer from event type)

### Optional Information
- **Special offers** (credits, trials, discounts)
- **Partnerships** (sponsors, collaborators)
- **Prerequisites** (accounts, tools, equipment)
- **Pricing** (or use event type default)
- **Post-event activities** (networking, food, drinks)
- **Registration link** (if available)

---

## Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Immediate Draft Generation

**Do NOT ask questions first.** Generate immediately with the information you have.

**For missing information, use:**
1. **Event type defaults** from `tone-learnings.json` ‚Üí `placeholder_defaults`
2. **Smart assumptions** based on historical patterns
3. **Clear placeholders** in format `[ITEM TBD]` for unknowns

**Generate all three outputs:**
- Event page content (full description)
- Front-page blurb (50-100 words)
- Email announcement (complete email with subject line)

### Step 2: Show Draft to User

Present the draft in this exact format:

```markdown
# Event Content Generation - [Event Name]
**Generated:** [timestamp]
**Event Type:** [Detected type]
**Saved to:** /generated/YYYY/MM/event-name-draft.md

## MISSING INFORMATION
- [ ] Capacity/registration limit
- [ ] Guest speaker details
- [ ] Special offers or partnerships
- [ ] [Other missing items]

---

## EVENT PAGE CONTENT

[Full event page content here]

---

## FRONT-PAGE BLURB

[Concise 50-100 word promotional text]

---

## EMAIL ANNOUNCEMENT

**Subject:** [Generated subject line]

[Complete email body]

---
```

### Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions

After showing the draft, ask targeted questions about missing information:

**Question format:**
- One question at a time or grouped related questions
- Multiple choice when possible
- Reference the placeholder in the draft
- Make it conversational

**Example questions:**
- "I used Mesh Nationaltheateret as the venue since that's typical for Vibelabs events. Is that correct, or should it be somewhere else?"
- "What's the capacity for this event? (Typical Vibelabs events are 150-300)"
- "Should I mention any partnerships or special offers? (e.g., V0 credits, Databutton trials)"

### Step 4: Regenerate with New Information

When the user provides answers:
- Update the draft with the new information
- Remove placeholders that are now filled
- Keep the same file path
- Update the timestamp and "MISSING INFORMATION" section

### Step 5: Iterate Until Finalized

Continue the question ‚Üí answer ‚Üí regenerate cycle until:
- User explicitly says they're satisfied
- All information is provided and placeholders removed
- User begins editing the file themselves

**When finalized:**
- User saves the file anywhere in the events folder
- System automatically learns from the finalized content (handled by future diff analysis)

---

## Tone of Voice Application

### Always Do:
1. **Read tone-of-voice-guide.md completely** before generating
2. **Reference tone-learnings.json** for pattern frequencies and event-type associations
3. **Match formality level** to event type (casual for Vibelabs, formal for ANFO)
4. **Use Norwegian/English mixing** according to event type patterns
5. **Include concrete outcomes** - what attendees will build/take away
6. **Apply temporal weighting** - newer patterns from 2025 Q3-Q4 take precedence
7. **Use pizza emoji** üçï for Vibelabs events with V0 sponsorship
8. **Be specific** - "build a ChatGPT clone" not "learn about AI"

### Never Do:
1. **Don't use hype words** - "revolutionary", "game-changing" unless genuinely warranted
2. **Don't make vague promises** - "master AI" or "learn everything"
3. **Don't overuse emojis** - max 2-3 per piece, prefer pizza emoji for Vibelabs
4. **Don't mix formal/casual** within the same piece - pick a lane
5. **Don't forget the pizza** - Vibelabs events almost always mention V0 pizza sponsorship
6. **Don't skip concrete details** - always include what attendees actually build
7. **Don't be generic** - reference specific tools, platforms, outcomes

## Placeholder Strategy

When information is missing, use intelligent placeholders:

### Format
`[ITEM TBD]` - All caps, descriptive, in square brackets

### Examples
- `[VENUE TBD]` - when location unknown
- `[GUEST SPEAKER TBD]` - when speaker not specified
- `[CAPACITY TBD]` - when registration limit not provided
- `[REGISTRATION LINK TBD]` - when signup URL not available
- `[TIME TBD]` - when start time unclear

### Smart Defaults (use these instead of TBD when reasonable)

**Vibelabs events:**
- Venue: "Mesh Nationaltheateret" or "Mesh Youngstorget" (mention both if unsure)
- Time: "17:00" (most common)
- Duration: "2-3 hours"
- Price: "Free for all attendees"
- Pizza: "Pizza sponsored by V0 üçï"

**Shifter courses:**
- Time: "09:00-16:00 (doors open 08:30)"
- Format: Three-part structure (Websites ‚Üí Web Apps ‚Üí Going Live)
- Prerequisites: GitHub, V0.dev ($20/month), OpenAI Platform ($5)
- Investment: "~NOK 300+ in tools"

**ANFO events:**
- Venue: "ANFO Telegrafen" or "Holter venue"
- Audience: "Marketing and communication leaders"
- Format: "Mix of presentation and hands-on workshop"

**Corporate:**
- Venue: "[Client] offices"
- Format: "Interactive workshop"
- Customization: "Tailored to your team's needs"

### When to Use TBD vs Defaults
- Use defaults when they're very likely correct (>80% confidence)
- Use TBD when information is truly unknown and no reasonable default exists
- Always note assumptions in the MISSING INFORMATION section

---

## File Naming & Organization

### Draft Filename Format
`/generated/YYYY/MM/event-name-draft.md`

**Examples:**
- `/generated/2025/11/ai-agents-workshop-nov-20-draft.md`
- `/generated/2025/12/vibelabs-monthly-dec-15-draft.md`
- `/generated/2025/10/anfo-breakfast-event-draft.md`

### Filename Rules
1. **Lowercase** with hyphens (kebab-case)
2. **Descriptive** but concise (3-6 words)
3. **Include date** in filename when clear (month-day or just month)
4. **Always end** with `-draft.md`
5. **Event type** can be prefix (vibelabs-, shifter-, anfo-, corporate-)

### Auto-create Directories
If `/generated/YYYY/MM/` doesn't exist, create it automatically

### Example Full Path
`/Users/.../docs/events/generated/2025/11/ai-agents-workshop-nov-20-draft.md`

---

## Learning from User Edits

**Automatic Learning Process (future implementation):**

When user finalizes content by saving edited file anywhere in events folder:

1. **Diff Analysis:** Compare generated draft to finalized version
2. **Extract Patterns:**
   - Phrases user added
   - Phrases user removed
   - Structural changes (reordering, reformatting)
   - Tone adjustments (more casual/formal)
   - Placeholder preferences
3. **Update tone-learnings.json:**
   - Increment frequency of user-added phrases
   - Decrement frequency of user-removed phrases
   - Note structural preferences
   - Apply temporal weighting (newest edits weighted most)
4. **Apply in Future Generations:**
   - Prefer user-added patterns
   - Avoid user-removed patterns
   - Match structural preferences

**Current State:**
- Manual learning only (edit tone-of-voice-guide.md directly)
- Automatic diff analysis to be implemented
- Track learnings in `edit_patterns` section of tone-learnings.json

**Missing Information Note:**
```
## MISSING INFORMATION
- [ ] Specific venue (Rebel, Schibsted offices, or other)
- [ ] Registration link
- [ ] Course capacity
- [ ] Course documents (Google Docs to be created)
```

---

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

### User Input is Too Vague

**Example:** "Event next month about AI"

**Response:**
Generate a minimal draft with maximum placeholders, then ask:
- "What type of event is this? (Vibelabs community, Shifter course, corporate workshop, or something else?)"
- "Which date next month?"
- "What specific AI topic or outcome?"

### User Provides Conflicting Information

**Example:** "Free Shifter course" (Shifter is typically paid)

**Response:**
Generate using the explicit information (free in this case), but note in MISSING INFORMATION:
- [ ] Confirm pricing model - Shifter courses are typically commercial, but you mentioned "free"

### Multiple Guest Speakers

**Example:** "Guests from Lovable, Databutton, and V0"

**Response:**
- Create program with time allocated for each speaker
- Ask for speaker names if not provided
- Suggest format: "Would you like individual sessions or a panel discussion?"

### Date is Ambiguous

**Example:** "Next Tuesday"

**Response:**
- Calculate the actual date based on current date
- Note in draft: "Assuming 'next Tuesday' is [specific date]"
- Ask: "I've scheduled this for [date]. Is that correct?"

---

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting a draft, verify:

- [ ] Event type correctly detected
- [ ] All three outputs generated (Event Page, Blurb, Email)
- [ ] Tone matches event type (casual for Vibelabs, professional for ANFO, etc.)
- [ ] Norwegian/English mixing follows patterns for event type
- [ ] Concrete outcomes specified (what attendees build/take away)
- [ ] Event details formatted correctly (bold labels, bullet points)
- [ ] Placeholders clearly marked as `[ITEM TBD]`
- [ ] Smart defaults used where appropriate
- [ ] Pizza emoji üçï included for Vibelabs events (if V0 sponsor assumed)
- [ ] File saved to correct path: `/generated/YYYY/MM/event-name-draft.md`
- [ ] MISSING INFORMATION section lists all unknowns
- [ ] Email subject line follows event type pattern
- [ ] No hype words or vague promises
- [ ] Emoji count ‚â§ 2-3 per output
- [ ] Prerequisites listed if required (Shifter, corporate workshops)
- [ ] Partnership mentions included if known (V0, Databutton, etc.)

---

## Handling Tone Adjustment Requests

### When User Provides Tone Instructions

If the user says something like:
- "Tone down the use of emojis drastically"
- "Make everything more professional"
- "Use fewer words, keep it concise"
- "Always mention our partnership with X"
- "Be more casual in the writing"

**Immediately update `tone-overrides.md`** with the instruction.

### How to Update tone-overrides.md

1. **Read the current file** to see existing overrides
2. **Identify the category** (Emoji Usage, Formality Level, Content Structure, etc.)
3. **Add the override** in clear, actionable format:
   ```markdown
   **OVERRIDE:** [Clear instruction]
   ```
4. **Confirm with user:**
   "I've added this override to your tone settings: [quote the override]. This will apply to all future event generations. You can remove it anytime by asking me to, or by editing tone-overrides.md directly."

### Example Interactions

**User:** "Tone down the use of emojis drastically"

**AI Response:**
```markdown
I've updated tone-overrides.md with:

**OVERRIDE:** Use emojis very sparingly - maximum 1 per entire output (all three sections combined)

This will apply to all future event generations. I can remove or adjust this anytime if you change your mind.

Would you still like me to generate an event, or was this just a style adjustment?
```

---

**User:** "Make everything shorter, people don't read long emails"

**AI Response:**
```markdown
I've updated tone-overrides.md with:

**OVERRIDE:** Maximum 150 words for event pages, 50 words for blurbs, 200 words for emails

This will apply to all future event generations. I can remove or adjust this anytime.

Would you like me to generate an event now, or was this just updating the style?
```

---

**User:** "Remove the emoji restriction"

**AI Response:**
```markdown
I've removed the emoji override from tone-overrides.md. Future events will use the default emoji patterns from the historical events (moderate use for Vibelabs, minimal for professional events).

Anything else I can help with?
```

### Override Categories

Use these categories when adding overrides:

**Emoji Usage**
- Frequency: none, minimal, moderate, liberal
- Context: when and where to use

**Formality Level**
- Scale: 1-10 formality
- By event type adjustments

**Language Mixing**
- Norwegian vs English balance
- Code-switching preferences

**Content Structure**
- Length constraints
- Section ordering
- Detail level

**Partnership Mentions**
- Which partners to emphasize
- Placement (opening, closing, etc.)

**Call to Action**
- Urgency level
- Positioning
- Registration link handling

**Specific Phrases**
- Words/phrases to use
- Words/phrases to avoid

### Multiple Overrides

Overrides can stack:
```markdown
**OVERRIDE:** Use maximum 1 emoji per output
**OVERRIDE:** Keep all content under 200 words per section
**OVERRIDE:** Always mention V0 partnership in opening paragraph
```

All three will apply simultaneously.

### Removing Overrides

**To remove one override:**
Comment it out or delete it from tone-overrides.md

**To remove all overrides:**
Delete all `**OVERRIDE:**` lines from the file

**Via conversation:**
User: "Remove the emoji restriction"
AI: Updates tone-overrides.md by commenting out or removing that line

### Priority Reminder

**tone-overrides.md always wins** over:
- tone-of-voice-guide.md
- tone-learnings.json
- Historical patterns

Even if historical events use lots of emojis, an override to use none will be respected.

---

## Final Notes

**Remember:**
- Generate first, ask questions later
- Use smart defaults from tone-learnings.json
- Match tone to event type
- Be specific and concrete
- Pizza emoji for Vibelabs üçï
- Norwegian/English mixing is natural and expected
- Newer patterns (2025 Q3-Q4) weighted most heavily
- The user will edit and finalize - your job is to give them 80% of the way there

**Success = User says:**
"This is great, just need to tweak [small detail]"

**Not:**
"This doesn't sound like me at all, let me rewrite it"

---

**When in doubt:**
1. Check tone-overrides.md for active instructions (highest priority)
2. Check tone-of-voice-guide.md for explicit rules
3. Reference historical events of the same type
4. Use patterns from tone-learnings.json
5. Ask the user for clarification

Good luck! üöÄ
