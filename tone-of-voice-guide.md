---

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Universal Traits (All Event Types)

**Enthusiasm without hype**
- Genuine excitement about what's possible
- Focus on practical outcomes over buzzwords
- "This is what you'll actually build" not "revolutionary game-changing paradigm shift"

**Accessible expertise**
- Assumes no prior coding knowledge for community events
- Explains technical concepts in plain language
- "Without writing code" / "Uten noe som helst kodekompetanse"

**Action-oriented**
- "Build", "Create", "Launch" over "Learn about"
- Concrete deliverables mentioned early
- What participants will take away, not just what they'll hear

**Transparent and honest**
- Acknowledges limitations ("not fully tested in course setting")
- Clear about costs ("~NOK 300+ in tools")
- Upfront about prerequisites and requirements

---

## Language Mixing Patterns

### Norwegian/English Code-Switching

**Primary language by event type:**
- **Vibelabs community:** Primarily Norwegian with English tech terms
- **Shifter courses:** Norwegian (subject lines, descriptions)
- **ANFO events:** Norwegian (professional audience)
- **Corporate:** Matches client preference, defaulting to Norwegian

**Tech terms always in English:**
- "Vibecoding", "AI", "prompt", "backend", "frontend", "app", "API"
- Platform names: "V0.dev", "GitHub", "Firebase", "Supabase"
- "Live coding", "hackathon", "MVP", "full-day course"

**Natural Norwegian phrases:**
- "Takk for..." (gratitude openers)
- "Kjempeg√∏y at..." (enthusiasm)
- "Dette blir..." (future-focused excitement)
- "Kun X plasser" (scarcity/urgency)
- "Uten koding" / "helt uten kode" (no-code emphasis)

**When to code-switch mid-sentence:**
‚úì "L√¶r √• bygge websider, prototyper og apper med AI"
‚úì "Building multi-agent AI smart apps"
‚úì "Dette kurset snur tradisjonell utvikling p√• hodet"
‚úó Avoid awkward switches that break flow

## Emoji Usage Rules

### When to Use Emojis

**Vibelabs Community Events:** Moderate use, adds personality
- Pizza sponsorship: üçï (almost always)
- Enthusiasm/excitement: üòä (occasional)
- Event type indicators: üé™ (rare, only when contextually relevant)

**Shifter/ANFO/Corporate:** Minimal to none
- Professional context = emoji-free
- Exception: Internal team communications might include üòä for warmth

**Placement:**
- End of sentences, never mid-sentence
- Highlights specific elements (food, special offers)
- Not in subject lines or formal headings

**Don't overuse:**
- Maximum 2-3 per email
- None in body text for formal events
- Pizza emoji is the most consistent exception

## Sentence Structure & Rhythm

### Opening Hooks

**Community events (Vibelabs):**
- Direct invitation: "Join us for..."
- Contextual opener: "After an incredible summer..."
- Announcement style: "Vi er tilbake!"
- Reference continuity: "Following up on our last session..."

**Professional events (ANFO, Corporate):**
- Gratitude: "Takk for engasjerende og interessant foredrag..."
- Context-setting: "As we discussed at..."

**Courses (Shifter):**
- Countdown/urgency: "Tomorrow we're building..."
- Preparation: "Before the course tomorrow, please ensure..."
- Reminder: "Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at..."

### Sentence Length Variation

**Mix short and long:**
- Short for impact: "Dette blir bra." "No coding required." "Free for all attendees."
- Long for explanation: "Det unike med kurset er at du bygger med ekte, profesjonell kode ‚Äì uten √• v√¶re utvikler."

**Paragraph rhythm:**
- 1-2 sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- 3-4 sentence paragraphs for explanation
- Bullet lists for details (time, location, requirements)

### Punctuation Personality

**Exclamation marks:**
- Use for genuine excitement, not every sentence
- Common in Vibelabs: "Dette blir kjempebra!!"
- Rare in corporate: "We look forward to the session."

**Em dashes for clarity:**
- Explanatory additions: "vibecoding ‚Äì a method for building apps through AI"
- Lists: "You'll learn to build websites ‚Äì with beautiful design"

**Questions as hooks:**
- "What happens when prototyping takes minutes instead of weeks?"
- "Want to go from 20% more effective to 200% more effective?"

## Placeholder Patterns

When information is missing, use contextually appropriate placeholders:

**Format:**
- `[VENUE TBD]` - all caps, descriptive
- `[TIME TBD]`
- `[CAPACITY TBD]`
- `[GUEST SPEAKER TBD]`

**Common defaults (Vibelabs):**
- Venue: Mesh Nationaltheateret or Mesh Youngstorget
- Time: 15:00 or 17:00 start time
- Duration: 2-3 hours
- Format: Mix of presentation + hands-on

**Smart assumptions:**
- Vibelabs = free, pizza, V0 partnership
- Shifter = commercial, full-day, prerequisites required
- ANFO = professional audience, mix of free and paid
- Corporate = custom, flexible format

## Tone Calibration Examples

### Too Casual (Avoid)
"Yo! We're doing this sick AI event next week. It's gonna be lit! Come through and we'll build some dope stuff together lol üî•üî•üî•"

### Too Formal (Avoid for Community)
"We cordially invite you to attend a professional development workshop focused on the systematic implementation of artificial intelligence-assisted application development methodologies."

### Just Right (Vibelabs Community)
"Vi er tilbake! Join us Tuesday at 17:00 for live vibecoding at Mesh Youngstorget. We'll build something amazing together, learn about the latest AI tool updates, and enjoy pizza sponsored by V0. üçï Free for everyone ‚Äì see you there!"

### Just Right (Professional/ANFO)
"Thank you for joining our June workshop. Building on that success, we're offering two full-day AI-skolen courses on December 2nd. You'll learn to build professional applications without coding ‚Äì from concept to launch in one day. Limited to 20 participants per session."
